# Unbarred
This repository contains a static site for teaching Digital Humanities in prison, developed by Kelly Hammond, Quinn Bolewicki and Sabina Pringle in Patrick Smyth's Software Design Lab at The Graduate Center - CUNY in spring 2019. The "Why DH?" page of the static site, which can be comfortably viewed on Github Pages, explains what the site is for.
